By default the plugin uses regular Grails domain classes to access its required data. It's easy to create your own user lookup code though, which can access the database or any other source to retrieve user and authority data. See [Custom UserDetailsService|guide:userDetailsService] for how to implement this.

To use the standard user lookup you'll need at a minimum a 'person' and an 'authority' domain class. In addition, if you want to store URL<->Role mappings in the database (this is one of multiple approaches for defining the mappings) you need a 'requestmap' domain class. If you use the recommended approach for mapping the many-to-many relationship between 'person' and 'authority,' you also need a domain class to map the join table.

To use the user/group lookup you'll also need a 'group' domain class. If you are using the recommended approach for mapping many-to-many relationship between 'person' and 'group' and between 'group' and 'authority' you'll need a domain class for each to map the join tables. You can still additionally use 'requestmap' with this approach.

The [s2-quickstart|Scripts] and [s2-quickstart-groups|Scripts] scripts create initial domain classes for you. You specify the package and class names, and it creates the corresponding domain classes. After that you can customize them as you like. You can add unlimited fields, methods, and so on, as long as the core security-related functionality remains.
