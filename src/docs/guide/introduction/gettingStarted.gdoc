If you will be migrating from the Acegi to the Spring Security plugin, see [Migrating from the Acegi Plugin|guide:acegiMigrating].

Once you install the plugin, you simply run the initialization script, [s2-quickstart|Scripts], and make any required configuration changes in @Config.groovy@. The plugin registers filters in @web.xml@, and also configures the Spring beans in the application context that implement various pieces of functionality.  Ivy determines which jar files to use.

To get started using the Spring Security plugin with your Grails application, see  [Tutorials|guide:tutorials].

You do not need to know much about Spring Security to use the plugin, but it can be helpful to understand the underlying implementation. See [the Spring Security documentation|http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/reference.html].
