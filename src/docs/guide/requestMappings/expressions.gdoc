Spring Security uses the [Spring Expression Language (SpEL)|http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/expressions.html], which allows you to declare the rules for guarding URLs more descriptively than does the traditional approach, and also allows much more fine-grained rules. Where you traditionally would specify a list of role names and/or special tokens (for example, @IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY@), with [Spring Security's expression support|http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.x/reference/html/el-access.html], you can instead use the embedded scripting language to define simple or complex access rules.

You can use expressions with any of the previously described approaches to securing application URLs. For example, consider this annotated controller:

{code}
package com.yourcompany.yourapp

import grails.plugin.springsecurity.annotation.Secured

class SecureController {

   @Secured(["hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')"])
   def someAction() {
      ...
   }

   @Secured(["authentication.name == 'ralph'"])
   def someOtherAction() {
      ...
   }
}
{code}

In this example, @someAction@ requires @ROLE_ADMIN@, and @someOtherAction@ requires that the user be logged in with username 'ralph'.

The corresponding @Requestmap@ URLs would be

{code}
new Requestmap(url: "/secure/someAction",
               configAttribute: "hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN'").save()

new Requestmap(url: "/secure/someOtherAction",
               configAttribute: "authentication.name == 'ralph'").save()
{code}

and the corresponding static mappings would be

{code}
grails.plugin.springsecurity.interceptUrlMap = [
   '/secure/someAction':      ["hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN'"],
   '/secure/someOtherAction': ["authentication.name == 'ralph'"]
]
{code}

The Spring Security docs have a [table listing the standard expressions|http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.2.x/reference/html/el-access.html#el-common-built-in], which is copied here for reference:

{table}
*Expression* | *Description*
@hasRole(role)@ | Returns true if the current principal has the specified role.
@hasAnyRole(\[role1,role2\])@ | Returns true if the current principal has any of the supplied roles (given as a comma-separated list of strings)
@principal@ | Allows direct access to the principal object representing the current user
@authentication@ | Allows direct access to the current Authentication object obtained from the SecurityContext
@permitAll@ | Always evaluates to true
@denyAll@ | Always evaluates to false
@isAnonymous()@ | Returns true if the current principal is an anonymous user
@isRememberMe()@ | Returns true if the current principal is a remember-me user
@isAuthenticated()@ | Returns true if the user is not anonymous
@isFullyAuthenticated()@ | Returns true if the user is not an anonymous or a remember-me user
@request@ | the HTTP request, allowing expressions such as "isFullyAuthenticated() or request.getMethod().equals('OPTIONS')"
{table}

In addition, you can use a web-specific expression @hasIpAddress@. However, you may find it more convenient to separate IP restrictions from role restrictions by using the [IP address filter|guide:ip].

To help you migrate traditional configurations to expressions, this table compares various configurations and their corresponding expressions:

{table}
*Traditional Config* | *Expression*
@ROLE_ADMIN@ | @hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN')@
@ROLE_USER,ROLE_ADMIN@ | @hasAnyRole('ROLE_USER','ROLE_ADMIN')@
@ROLE_ADMIN,IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY@ | @hasRole('ROLE_ADMIN') and isFullyAuthenticated()@
@IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY@ | @permitAll@
@IS_AUTHENTICATED_REMEMBERED@ | @isAuthenticated() or isRememberMe()@
@IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY@ | @isFullyAuthenticated()@
{table}
