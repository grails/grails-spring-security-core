Another authentication mechanism supported by Spring Security is certificate-based, or "mutual authentication". It requires HTTPS, and you must configure the server to require a client certificate (ordinarily only the server provides a certificate). Your username is extracted from the client certificate if it is valid, and you are "pre-authenticated". As long as a corresponding username exists in the database, your authentication succeeds and you are not asked for a password. Your @Authentication@ contains the authorities associated with your username.

The table describes available configuration options.

{table}
*Property* | *Default Value* | *Meaning*
useX509 | @false@ | Whether to support certificate-based logins
x509.continueFilterChainOn UnsuccessfulAuthentication | @true@ | Whether to proceed when an authentication attempt fails to allow other authentication mechanisms to process the request.
x509.subjectDnRegex | 'CN=(.*?)(?:,\|$)' | Regular expression (regex) for extracting the username from the certificate's subject name.
x509.checkForPrincipalChanges | @false@ | Whether to re-extract the username from the certificate and check that it's still the current user when a valid @Authentication@ already exists.
x509.invalidateSessionOn PrincipalChange | @true@ | Whether to invalidate the session if the principal changed (based on a @checkForPrincipalChanges@ check).
x509.subjectDnClosure | none | If set, the plugin's @ClosureX509PrincipalExtractor@ class is used to extract information from the X.509 certificate using the specified closure
x509. throwException WhenTokenRejected | @false@ | If @true@ thrown a @BadCredentialsException@

The details of configuring your server for SSL and configuring browser certificates are beyond the scope of this document. If you use Tomcat, see its [SSL documentation|https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/ssl-howto.html]. To get a test environment working, see the instructions in [this discussion at Stack Overflow|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1180397/tomcat-server-client-self-signed-ssl-certificate].
