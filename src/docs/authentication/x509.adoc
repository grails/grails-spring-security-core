=== Certificate (X.509) Login Authentication

Another authentication mechanism supported by Spring Security is certificate-based, or "`mutual authentication`". It requires HTTPS, and you must configure the server to require a client certificate (ordinarily only the server provides a certificate). Your username is extracted from the client certificate if it is valid, and you are "`pre-authenticated`". As long as a corresponding username exists in the database, your authentication succeeds and you are not asked for a password. Your `Authentication` contains the authorities associated with your username.

The table describes available configuration options.

|Whether to invalidate the session if the principal changed (based on a `checkForPrincipalChanges` check)

|x509.subjectDnClosure

The details of configuring your server for SSL and configuring browser certificates are beyond the scope of this document. If you use Tomcat, see its https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/ssl-howto.html[SSL documentation]. To get a test environment working, see the instructions in https://stackoverflow.com/q/1180397/160313[this discussion at Stack Overflow].
