== Installation

=== Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following set up:

* A Grails project
* A working internet connection

=== Installation Steps

1. Open your Grails project.

2. Locate your `build.gradle` file in the root directory of your project.

3. Add the Spring Security Core Plugin dependency to the `dependencies` section in your `build.gradle`:

+
[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
dependencies {
    // ... other dependencies
    implementation 'org.grails.plugins:spring-security-core:{stableversion}'
}
----
+

4. Save the `build.gradle` file.

5. Open a terminal or command prompt.

6. Navigate to your project's root directory using the `cd` command.

7. Run the following Gradle command to update your project's dependencies:

+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew clean build
----
+

8. The Spring Security Core Plugin 6.0.0 is now installed and integrated into your Grails project.

9. You can start using the plugin's features and commands in your application.

10. Run the <<s2-quickstart>> script to generate domain classes and add the initial configuration settings in `application.groovy`:

+
[source,bash]
```
./gradlew runCommand "-Pargs==s2-quickstart com.yourapp User Role"
```

=== Verifying Installation

To verify that the plugin has been successfully installed, you can run a simple test:

1. In your Grails project, create a new controller or use an existing one.

2. Add a secure annotation, such as `@Secured(['ROLE_USER'])`, to a method in your controller.

3. Run your Grails application using the command:

+
[source,bash]
----
./gradlew bootRun
----
+

4. Access the URL associated with the method you secured. If the plugin is correctly installed, it should enforce the security constraint you defined.
