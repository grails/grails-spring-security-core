/**
 * Used in doWithSpring to allow overriding of the class of individual Spring beans by setting a property in the config.
 * The property name syntax is beanName + 'BeanClass', so for example to override the type of the 'authoritiesMapper'
 * bean, add a property <code>authoritiesMapperBeanClass = 'com.foo.Bar'</code> or
 * <code>authoritiesMapperBeanClass = com.foo.Bar</code>.
 *
 * This is useful when a bean override retains all of the configuration options of the original and only the class is
 * different. Just overriding the class (ordinarily done with a bean post-processor) allows redefined beans to use new
 * or changed properties in future versions of the plugin.
